# Decelle â€” Logic Circuit Simulator in Scheme

**Decelle** is a digital circuit simulator implemented in pure Scheme,
inspired by *SICP* (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
and *The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris)*.

The goal is to model wires, logic gates, circuits, and sequential
components (flip-flops, registers, RAM) using an event-driven
simulation model.
